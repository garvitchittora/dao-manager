Currently, Many big DAO are facing issues in listing their events and creating a directory of members. I have created a platform that fixes these problems.

On DAOfront, Users can find the list of members and the list of upcoming events for their DAO, and also any DAO member can also create an event for their DAO. Members can also join the event from our event and can also add it to their calendar.

I have also implemented a point system that depends on member activity. Every event is some points, if members attend the event their points will increase. This feature can also increase participation in the events.
